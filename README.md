OpenBox
=======

A simple chrome extension full of utilities. A torrent client, as well as uploader, a youtube music downloading client, and other cool stuff. The index file may contain random buttons that is used to test with. You can edit this as much as you like, just make sure to help out with the releases and stuff so we can get this thing moving. It will be uploaded to the chrome store, and you guys will be in the developer notes :) So please contribute, as this is some really easy stuff (HTML5, CSS3, JAVASCRIPT). Also, a manifest.json file will be uploaded soon. check back at this readme file for news every so often. Bye for now!
